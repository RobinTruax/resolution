# Checklist
This checklist should be completed by any alpha- or beta-tester on their system. If a check fails, please 
 - check the troubleshooting guide in the documentation.
 - check any open issues on GitHub (if one corresponds to your issue, leave a comment); if the issue is closed, update your copy of resolution.
 - open an issue on GitHub if none exists and the troubleshooting guide did not help. If it is a problem with resolution, it will be fixed, or if it is a common troubleshooting issue it will help improve the documentation.

## Computation: 
 - [ ] In a .tex file, try Leader-c to open the computational popup. In normal mode, it should open a blank popup. In visual mode, it should open with the input tex window populated by the selected information. Try entering both valid and invalid selections in both input windows. Try, in a project file, "sending" and "name-sending" SymPy code using "\s" and "\S".
 - [ ] In a .tex file in a project in the main project folder, try Leader-C to open the computational environment. It should be populated by any SymPy expressions "sent" using the keybinds "\s" and "\S" when the computational popup is open.
