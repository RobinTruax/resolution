  abstract = {Given a simple graph \$G\$, one can define a hyperplane arrangement called the \$G\$-Shi arrangement. The Pak-Stanley algorithm labels the regions of this arrangement with \$G\_\textbackslash bullet\$-parking functions. When \$G\$ is a complete graph, we recover the Shi arrangement, and the Pak-Stanley labels give a bijection with ordinary parking functions. However, for proper subgraphs \$G \textbackslash subset K\_n\$, while the Pak-Stanley labels still include every \$G\_\{\textbackslash bullet\}\$-parking function, some appear more than once. These repetitions of Pak-Stanley labels are a topic of interest in the study of \$G\$-Shi arrangements and \$G\_\{\textbackslash bullet\}\$-parking functions. Furthermore, \$G\_\{\textbackslash bullet\}\$-parking functions are connected to many other combinatorial objects (for example, superstable configurations in chip-firing). In studying these repetitions, we can draw on existing results about these objects such as Dhar's Burning Algorithm. Conversely, our results have implications for the study of these objects as well. The key insight of our work is the introduction of a combinatorial model called the Three Rows Game. Analyzing the histories of this game and how they induce identical outcomes lets us characterize the multiplicities of the Pak-Stanley labels. Using this model, we develop a classification theorem for the multiplicities of the Pak-Stanley labels of the regions in the \$P\_n\$-Shi arrangement, where \$P\_n\$ is the path graph on \$n\$ vertices. Then, we generalize the Three Rows Game into the \$T\$-Three Rows Game. This allows us to study the multiplicities of the Pak-Stanley labels of the regions in \$T\$-Shi arrangements, where \$T\$ is any tree. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and difficulties in applying our method to arbitrary graphs. In particular, we analyze multiplicities in the case when \$G\$ is a cycle graph, and prove a uniqueness result for maximal \$G\_\{\textbackslash bullet\}\$-parking functions for all graphs using the Three Rows Game.},

  abstract = {Let \$A\$ be an abelian surface over an algebraically closed field \$\textbackslash overline\{k\}\$. We describe a rich collection of relations in the kernel of the Albanese map of \$A\$ arising from hyperelliptic curves. When \$\textbackslash overline\{k\}\$ admits an embedding \$\textbackslash overline\{k\}\textbackslash hookrightarrow\textbackslash mathbb\{C\}\$ and \$A\$ is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves, we prove that for infinitely many integers \$g\textbackslash geq 2\$, there are infinitely many non-isomorphic hyperelliptic curves of genus \$g\$ mapping birationally into \$A\$. We use these results to give some progress towards Beilinson's conjecture for zero-cycles, which predicts that for a smooth projective variety \$X\$ over \$\textbackslash overline\{\textbackslash mathbb\{Q\}\}\$ the kernel of the Albanese map of \$X\$ is zero.},

  abstract = {An \textbackslash "\{u\}bercrossing diagram is a knot diagram with only one crossing that may involve more than two strands of the knot. Such a diagram without any nested loops is called a petal projection. Every knot has a petal projection from which the knot can be recovered using a permutation that represents strand heights. Using this permutation, we give an algorithm that determines the \$p\$-colorability and the determinants of knots from their petal projections. In particular, we compute the determinants of all prime knots with crossing number less than \$10\$ from their petal permutations.},
