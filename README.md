# `rsltn`: write better $\TeX$, faster
**rsltn** (pronounced, and often typeset, *resolution*) is a $\LaTeX$ IDE built on Neovim, a fork of Vim. The name **rsltn** stands for *R*oshan's *S*ystem for *L*a*T*eX in *N*eovim, but it also refers to the goal of the project: the *resolution* of the various aspects of producing math in LaTeX into a single frictionless system. Using shortcuts & snippets, *resolution* optimizes the process of writing math in LaTeX, but by integrating computational (and, in upcoming versions, figure-creation and visualization) tools, *resolution* also streamlines the process of *creating* math.

*resolution* is a beginner-friendly and infinitely customizable introduction to both $\LaTeX$ and Vim. It's open-source, fast (starting in 50ms on my average laptop), available on all major operating systems, and committed to looking beautiful. The next section gives an idea of what writing LaTeX in *resolution* looks like; after that is a complete introduction to getting started with *resolution* on any of the major operating systems.

**Disclaimer:** *resolution* **is currently in a private alpha stage. Expect breaking changes in the editor; however, the TeX style files included in** *resolution* **will remain mostly consistent to avoid breaking any TeX created using** *resolution*.
