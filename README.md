# `rsltn`: write better $\TeX$ faster
**rsltn** (pronounced, and often typeset, **resolution**) is a $\LaTeX$ IDE built on Neovim, a fork of Vim. The name **rsltn** stands for *R*obin's *S*ystem for *L*a*T*eX in *N*eovim, but it also refers to the goal of the project: the *resolution* of the various aspects of producing math in LaTeX into a single frictionless system. Using shortcuts & snippets, **rsltn** optimizes the process of writing down math in LaTeX, but by integrating computational (and, in upcoming versions, figure-creation and visualization) tools, **rsltn** also streamlines the process of *creating* the math itself.

**rsltn** is a beginner-friendly and infinitely customizable introduction to both $\LaTeX$ and Vim. It's open-source, fast (starting in 50ms on my average laptop), available on all major operating systems, and, most importantly, committed to looking *beautiful*. The next section gives an idea of what writing LaTeX in **rsltn** looks like; after that is a complete introduction to getting started with **rsltn** on any of the major operating systems.

## Demonstrations

#### Launching **rsltn** and opening a $\LaTeX$ project.

#### Using snippets and autocompletion to write definitions.

#### Performing seamless SymPy computation on matrices and integrals.

#### Navigating documents and peeking at definitions.

#### Creating and editing a local synced copy of an Overleaf project.
