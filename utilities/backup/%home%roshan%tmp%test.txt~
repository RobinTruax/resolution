by underscoring the importance of analysis which acknowledges the multiplicity of collective memory. Anderson discusses the origin of national identity, arguing that for a national narrative (founding myths, genealogies of self-justification, etc.) to form, there must be some hegemonic concentration of mnemonic power. 

Stonewall is a particularly powerful example of microhegemony to me personally because the recurring victims of microhegemony in the gay rights movement were, among others, people of color and trans people, of which I am both. I live in a time where the microhegemonic narrative in the LGBT community is one of, if not total acceptance, something close to it. I'm lucky to live at a point in time when I can consider attacks on trans rights from within the LGBT movement fringe (even if attacks on trans rights from outside are still mainstream, and in fact dominant). The point is that if it is important to acknowledge that exclusionary microhegemonic narratives can be just as materially damaging as macrohegemonic ones, it is equally important to recognize how valuable kind microhegemonic narratives can be in the face of broader oppression. Sometimes, splinters fly in the direction of good.
